# The 1978 Basic source code of The Oregon Trail ported to Python 3.7

A few changes were made here and there and though I originally did not intend to use classes at all, I ended up using one to store all the global variables in one place.

## To run the game:
```bash
python or78.py
```

## BASIC source code from:
https://github.com/fortran-gaming/oregon-trail-1975-basic

## BASIC keywords

See [docs/game_flow.md](docs/game_flow.md) for a high level overview of the game's flow.
